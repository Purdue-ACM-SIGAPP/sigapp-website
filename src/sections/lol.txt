Our projects go beyond class assignments — they solve real problems that our members care about. You’ll be building something that you (and others) will actually want to use.

We model our workflows on those used by top tech companies — think Git, sprints, code reviews — but in a fun, low-pressure setting. You’ll learn what it’s like to work on a **real dev team**.

#### 📚 Real-World Education

No experience? No problem! We welcome members from all backgrounds and skill levels. Our experienced team will help you ramp up quickly, whether you’re learning your first programming language or shipping your first full-stack app.

We build with modern, industry-relevant tools:

* **Frontend**: React Native, Flutter (Dart), Swift
